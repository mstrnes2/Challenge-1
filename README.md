# Challenge-1

## Description

In this project I have made the code more accessible. Instead of using div elements, I have changed the code to be easier to read for screen readers. It helps structure the page so that it can be more accessible. I have learned how to structure html code.


## Usage

I have changed the div elements to different elements to help structure the page. 

For example the header element was a div element.

## Credits

I have used these websites to help me structure the page.
